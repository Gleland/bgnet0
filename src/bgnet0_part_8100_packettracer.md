# Appendix: Installing Packet Tracer {#appendix-packettracer}

This week we're going to building a number of small networks in a
simulator. This simulator, called _Packet Tracer_ is provided for free
by [Cisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco) (as long as you sign up
for a free class, which you don't have to take--though it is useful).

This project is to get an account set up at Cisco, download Packet
Tracer, and run it.

## Download Packet Tracer

How to get your download directly (if you want to go via the online
Cisco courses interface, see below):

1. Head to the [Packet Tracer Download
   page](https://skillsforall.com/resources/lab-downloads).

2. Click "Log in".

3. Create an account.

4. Click the download link for your OS.

5. Install the software.

If you want to go through the free course, or if the above route isn't
working, try this:

1. Head on to the [Packet Tracer page at
   Cisco](https://skillsforall.com/topics/cisco-packet-tracer).

2. Click on the "Getting Started with Cisco Packet Tracer" course.

3. Click "Get Started".

4. Create an account.

5. Once you have your account, you should be able to follow the course
   material to the download link. (Or, if you're logged in, you could
   [try downloading from this
   link](https://skillsforall.com/resources/lab-downloads).)

## Run Packet Tracer

Once installed, run it!

If given the choice between "Net Academy" and "Skills for All" when
logging in, choose "Skills for All".

After launching Packet Tracer, you should see a bunch of circular
objects with numbers below them in the lower middle panel.

* Drag any 3 of them onto the main workspace. (Any three items of any
  type will do.)

* Then click the "Place Note" icon (second row on top, 5th from the
  left, looks like a clipboard). Then click on the workspace and enter
  your name. Hit `ESC` when done.

You haven't done much, but at least you've started getting a feel for
the tool.
